## 1. a)What is Abstract Data Types (ADT)? Explain the different primitive operations to be performed on the data structures.

Ans: Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.
The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented. It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations. It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view. The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction.

Primitive data structure are basic structures and are directly operated upon by machine instructions. Primitive data structure has different representation on the different computers. Primitive data structure is divided in to four categories:

- Integer
- Floating point numbers
- Character constants
- Pointers

## 1. b)How data structure is different from data types? Explain the meaning of linear and nonlinear data structure with suitable example.

Ans:

DATA TYPES | DATA STRUCTURES
-----------|----------------
Data Type is the kind or form of a variable which is being used throughout the program. It defines that the particular variable will assign the values of the given data type only | Data Structure is the collection of different kinds of data. That entire data can be represented using an object and can be used throughout the entire program.
Implementation through Data Types is a form of abstract implementation | Implementation through Data Structures is called concrete implementation
Can hold values and not data, so it is data less | Can hold different kind and types of data within one single object
Values can directly be assigned to the data type variables | The data is assigned to the data structure object using some set of algorithms and operations like push, pop and so on.
No problem of time complexity | Time complexity comes into play when working with data structures
Examples: int, float, double | Examples: stacks, queues, tree

Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent in what is called a linear data structure.Linear data structures are easy to implement because computer memory is arranged in a linear way.Its examples are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.

Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Its examples are trees and graphs.

## 1. c) List the applications of stack in computing as well as non-computing world. Write down the condition to check whether the element in linear queue is last element or not. Also mention how do you find the number of elements present in any queue?

Ans:
The applications of stack in computing world are:

- Stacks can be used for expression evaluation.
- Stacks can be used to check parenthesis matching in an expression.
- Stacks can be used for Conversion from one form of expression to another.
- Stacks can be used for Memory Management.
- Stack data structures are used in backtracking problems.

The applications of stack in real world are:

- Stack of plates in a buffet table
- Stack of Moulded chairs
- Books,Clothes piled on top of each other

Condition to check whether the element in linear queue is last element or not:

Suppose the element is e, the queue is Q[] with front and rear pointers then

if(e==Q[rear])
    Print"The element is last element"
    Else
    Print"The element is not last element"
    
Find the number of elements present in any queue:

Suppose a queue Q[], with max size (m),then total element(total)
     for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
     total++;
     }

## 2. a) Write an algorithm to convert infix expression to postfix expression. Convert the following postfix expression into infix expression: abc-+de-fg-h+/*

Ans: Algorithm

1. Scan the infix expression from left to right.
2. If the scanned character is an operand, output it.
3. Else,
    3.1 If the precedence of the scanned operator is greater than the precedence of the operator in the stack(or the stack is empty or the stack contains a ‘(‘ ), push it.
    3.2 Else, Pop all the operators from the stack which are greater than or equal to in precedence than that of the scanned operator. After doing that Push the scanned operator to the stack. (If you encounter parenthesis while popping then stop there and push the scanned operator in the stack.)
4. If the scanned character is an ‘(‘, push it to the stack.
5. If the scanned character is an ‘)’, pop the stack and and output it until a ‘(‘ is encountered, and discard both the parenthesis.
6. Repeat steps 2-6 until infix expression is scanned.
7. Print the output
8. Pop and output from the stack until it is not empty.

## 2. b) What is double ended queue? How does circular queue overcome the shortcoming of linear queue? Write an algorithm for traversing in circular queue.

Ans:Double ended queue is a more generalized form of queue data structure which allows insertion and removal of elements from both the ends, i.e , front and back.

Circular queue overcome the shortcoming of linear queue as:

1. A circular queue is better than a linear queue because the number of elements that can be stored is equal to the size of the array. This is not possible in linear because insertion cannot be done after the rear pointer reaches the end of the array.

2. A new item can be inserted in the location from where a previous item is deleted.

3. Infinite number of elements can be added continuously but deletion must be used.

4. It consumes less memory than the linear queue because a new item can be inserted in the location from where the previous one is deleted.

## 3. a) What are the advantages and disadvantages of Linked list? Write an algorithm to delete a node in specified position of singly linked list.

Ans:
The advantages of Linked list are as follows:

- Insertion operation is not a time consuming operation because shifting is not necessary to insert new element.
- Deletion operation is not a time consuming operation because left shifting is not necessary to delete elements.
- Memory can be physically released using the free function for latter allocation of nodes.
- The chances of memory wastage are minimum because memories are allocated dynamically as the requirement of the user.
- The concept of over following of values can not be arising in link list.

The disadvantages of Linked list are as follows:

- In single link list nodes are connected using a single pointer to point to the next node. If the link list is accidentally destroyed then the chances of data loss after the destruction point is maximum. Data recovery is not possible.
- In single link list every node contains a single pointer to represent next node So we can move only forwardly. Backward movement is not possible without recursion.
- In single link list any operations is performed sequentially and so for a huge no of data item any operation can be very slow.
- Link list can not contain detail description about its own as total number of node, Total no of deleted nodes, total number of updated nodes etc. Without any operation user can not display the detail description about the link list.

Algorithm to delete a node in specified position of singly linked list

1. If list is empty, just return.


2. If position equal to 0 to be deleted, we need to delete head node.

       1. Change head reference to head->next

3. Delete the old head. (free(head))

4.  Create a temp node(auxiliary node to store reference of node to be deleted).

5. Find previous node of node to be deleted. (temp)

6. Traverse in node based on the value of position-1 by running a loop.

7. We need to delete temp  → next, free it and unlink the deleted node.

8. If position is more than number of nodes, just return.

## 3. b)What are the applications of linked list? Explain with suitable example to perform the addition of two polynomials using linked list.

Ans: Applications of linked list in computer science –

- Implementation of stacks and queues
- Implementation of graphs : Adjacency list representation of graphs is most popular which is uses linked list to store adjacent vertices.
- Dynamic memory allocation : We use linked list of free blocks.
- Maintaining directory of names
- Performing arithmetic operations on long integers
- Manipulation of polynomials by storing constants in the node of linked list
- representing sparse matrices

## 4. a)Construct a BST from the following elements inserted in an order: 39, 45, 30, 60, 42, 35, 25, 32, 44. Also perform different tree traversals.

Ans:

## 4. b) What is weight balanced tree? Perform the AVL algorithm for following words are inserted in an order in an empty tree. BRIJESH, FIZZA, IMRAN, NAVIN, LOVELY, PRITY, SAMIT

Ans:

## 5. a)How recursion is different from iteration. Present your argument with suitable example for following statement: "Solving Fibonacci series using recursion is not efficient as compare with iteration".

Ans:
Key Differences between Recursion and Iteration

- A conditional statement decides the termination of recursion while a control variable’s value decide the termination of the iteration statement (except in the case of a while loop).
- Infinite recursion can lead to system crash whereas, infinite iteration consumes CPU cycles.
- Recursion repeatedly invokes the mechanism, and consequently the overhead, of method calls. This can be expensive in both processor time and memory space while iteration doesn’t.
- Recursion makes code smaller while iteration makes it longer.

## 5. b) What is stable and unstable sorting? Trace the quick sort algorithm for following unordered list: 25, 30, 18, 16, 45, 40, 60, 20, 10, 7, 30, 100, 12, 14.

Ans:

## 6. a) Compare set, matrix and linked list representation of graph. What are the difference between traversing in graph and traversing in tree? Explain with suitable example.

Ans:

## 6. b) 76, 26, 37, 59, 21, 65, 75, 49, 11. From above data, store the values into hash table with 10 positions, using division method (key% table size) of hashing and the linear probing and chaining method for resolving collision.

Ans:

## 7. Short notes on:

### 1. Heap sort

Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end.

Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in increasing order:

1. Build a max heap from the input data.
2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of tree.
3. Repeat above steps while size of heap is greater than 1.

### 2. Transitive closure

### 3. Big OH notation

It is the formal way to express the upper boundary of an algorithm running time. It measures the worst case of time complexity or the longest amount of time, algorithm takes to complete their operation. It is represented as shown below:

![Bio o notation](https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/ds-asymptotic-analysis.png)

For example: If f(n) and g(n) are the two functions defined for positive integers, then f(n) is O(g(n)) as f(n) is big oh of g(n) or f(n) is on the order of g(n)) if there exists constants c and no such that:

F(n)≤cg(n) for all n≥no

This implies that f(n) does not grow faster than g(n), or g(n) is an upper bound on the function f(n).
